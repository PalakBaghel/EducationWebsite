                Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, such as transmitting knowledge or
                fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the development of understanding,
                rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role of critical thinking in order
                to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that education results in an
                improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the term. In a slightly
                different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this process: the
                mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as the transmission of
                cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly encompass new
                ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society, empathy, and complex
                vocational skills.

                Types of education are commonly divided into formal, non-formal, and informal education. Formal
                education takes place in education and training institutions, is usually structured by curricular aims
                and objectives, and learning is typically guided by a teacher. In most regions, formal education is
                compulsory up to a certain age and commonly divided into educational stages such as kindergarten,
                primary school and secondary school.

                Nonformal education occurs as addition or alternative to formal education.[1] It may be structured
                according to educational arrangements, but in a more flexible manner, and usually takes place in
                community-based, workplace-based or civil society-based settings. Lastly, informal education occurs in
                daily life, in the family, any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or
                acts may be considered educational, whether unintentional or intentional. In practice there is a
                continuum from the highly formalized to the highly informalized, and informal learning can occur in all
                three settings.[2] For instance, homeschooling can be classified as nonformal or informal, depending
                upon the structure.

                Regardless of setting, educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion, and
                directed research. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy. Education is supported by a variety
                of different philosophies, theories and empirical research agendas.

                There are movements for education reforms, such as for improving quality and efficiency of education
                towards relevance in students' lives and efficient problem solving in modern or future society at large,
                or for evidence-based education methodologies.

                Numerous definitions of education have been suggested by theorists belonging to diverse fields.[6][7][8]
                Many agree that education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, especially the
                transmission of knowledge.[9] But they often include other aims as well, such as fostering skills and
                character traits.[9][6][10] However, there are deep disagreements about the exact nature of education
                besides these general characteristics. According to some conceptions, it is primarily a process that
                occurs during events like schooling, teaching, and learning.[11][12][7] Others understand it not as a
                process but as the achievement or product brought about by this process. On this view, education is what
                educated persons have, i.e. the mental states and dispositions that are characteristic of
                them.[11][12][7] However, the term may also refer to the academic study of the methods and processes
                taking place during teaching and learning, as well as the social institutions involved in these
                processes.[12] Etymologically, the word "education" is derived from the Latin word ēducātiō
